# Web Application Development - Golang

Not much of a library, just recording my progress as I learn to develop web applications with golang.

Currently, I'm reading a book from the author of gophercises.

I love to write frameworks and web apps from scratch. I immediately fell in love with golang when you need to manage sessions by yourself in it. I'm still a noob but nobody knows when I'll reach the place I never hoped for.

Enjoy!
